    <p>The dictionary definition of a religion is &ldquo;A particular system of faith and worship&rdquo;.
Dominant religions throughout history such as Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, and Islam have formed to function primarily
as a faith-based moral guideline, and secondarily as common ground to form communities. Current day science
functions much the same way.</p>

<p>The rigidity of science is due to the scientific method. Experiments are expected to be repeatable, and experiments are analyzed with
careful scrutiny. A scientist&rsquo;s duty is firmly to adhere to these principles.</p>

<p>We take science to be true based on the belief that others have adhered to the scientific method. But how many of us have observed these experiments?
How many of us are sure of their validity? Instead, we observe a faith-based system where we place our faith in the work of scientists and engineers.
It is impossible to stay up to date with all scientific research, and out of the question to replicate these experiments ourselves. Without observing experiments,
we cannot claim that any of them are true. Instead, the common man takes faith in science, just as he takes faith in Jesus.</p>

<p>Science is beginning to function in the same way as religion. For example, Atheists use science as a common ground
in order to create a better sense of unity and to disseminate their ideology. They champion modern science as complete truth, and rally against religious beliefs,
yet fail to see their hypocrisy. The big bang is just as unverifiable as a god creating the world. A paper released today about protein transcription is just as
unsubstantiated  to the common man as the story of Eve&rsquo;s temptation.</p>

<p>In the end, we all must ask ourselves where we place our trust. Can we trust in what scientists discover or pastors preach? Can we trust what we observe?
The answer is up to the individual to seek out.</p>
